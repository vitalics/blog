# What is Playwright Labs?

Playwright Labs is a curated monorepo of skills and best practices designed specifically for modern testing workflows. Think of it as a knowledge base that integrates seamlessly with your development environment, providing contextual guidance powered by AI and LLM agents.

The first package in this collection is **playwright-best-practices** - a comprehensive guide to writing better, faster, and more reliable Playwright tests.

## Why Playwright Labs?

Testing best practices are often scattered across documentation, blog posts, and tribal knowledge. Playwright Labs solves this by:

## Rule Format

Each rule follows a standardized format designed for both human and machine readability:

```markdown title="example-rule.md" caption="Standard rule format" showLineNumbers
---
title: "Use proper waits instead of timeouts"
impact: CRITICAL
description: "Avoid hardcoded sleeps and use Playwright's built-in waiting"
tags: [stability, waiting, async]
---

## Problem

Using hardcoded timeouts makes tests slow and unreliable.

❌ **Bad:**
\`\`\`typescript
await page.goto('https://example.com')
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000)) // Bad!
await page.click('button')
\`\`\`

✅ **Good:**
\`\`\`typescript
await page.goto('https://example.com')
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')
await page.click('button')
\`\`\`

## Why

Playwright has built-in auto-waiting that makes tests faster and more reliable.
```

### Frontmatter Metadata

- **title** - Clear, actionable rule name
- **impact** - CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM-HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW
- **description** - Optional detailed explanation
- **tags** - Searchable categories

## Key Best Practices Highlights

Let me share some of the most impactful practices from the package:

### 1. Use Built-in Auto-Waiting

Playwright automatically waits for elements to be ready. Don't fight it:

```typescript title="auto-waiting.ts" showLineNumbers
// ❌ Manual waiting
await page.waitForSelector("button");
await page.click("button");

// ✅ Auto-waiting (preferred)
await page.click("button"); // Automatically waits for button to be actionable
```

### 2. Prefer Role-Based Selectors

Use accessible locators for robust tests:

```typescript title="role-selectors.ts" showLineNumbers
// ❌ Fragile CSS selectors
await page.click(".btn-primary");

// ✅ Semantic role selectors
await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Submit" }).click();
```

### 3. Use Test Fixtures

Organize common setup with fixtures:

```typescript title="fixtures.ts" showLineNumbers
// Define fixture
export const test = base.extend<{ authenticatedPage: Page }>({
  authenticatedPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await page.goto("/login");
    await page.fill('[name="username"]', "testuser");
    await page.fill('[name="password"]', "password");
    await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
    await use(page);
  },
});

// Use in tests
test("user dashboard", async ({ authenticatedPage }) => {
  await authenticatedPage.goto("/dashboard");
  await expect(authenticatedPage.getByText("Welcome")).toBeVisible();
});
```

### 4. Enable Parallel Execution

Maximize test speed with parallelization:

```typescript title="playwright.config.ts" showLineNumbers
export default defineConfig({
  // Run tests in parallel across 4 workers
  workers: process.env.CI ? 2 : 4,

  // Fully parallel execution mode
  fullyParallel: true,

  // Retry failed tests
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
});
```

### 5. Use Proper Assertions

Playwright provides auto-retrying assertions:

```typescript title="assertions.ts" showLineNumbers
// ❌ Manual checks (no retry)
const text = await page.locator(".status").textContent();
expect(text).toBe("Success");

// ✅ Auto-retrying assertions
await expect(page.locator(".status")).toHaveText("Success");
```

## Development Workflow

If you want to contribute or customize rules:

### Build Commands

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Generate AGENTS.md from rules
pnpm build

# Validate rule format
pnpm validate

# Extract test cases for LLM evaluation
pnpm extract-tests
```

### Adding a New Rule

1. **Copy the template**:

   ```bash
   cp rules/_template.md rules/stable-my-new-rule.md
   ```

2. **Fill in the content** with title, impact, examples

3. **Build the package**:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

4. **Validate your rule**:
   ```bash
   pnpm validate
   ```

The build system automatically:

- Generates sequential IDs
- Sorts rules alphabetically
- Compiles everything into `AGENTS.md`
- Extracts test cases for validation

## Impact Levels Explained

Rules are categorized by their impact on test quality:

| Impact Level    | Description                              | Focus Area     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **CRITICAL**    | Major improvements to stability or speed | Must implement |
| **HIGH**        | Significant quality improvements         | High priority  |
| **MEDIUM-HIGH** | Notable benefits with some effort        | Recommended    |
| **MEDIUM**      | Incremental improvements                 | Nice to have   |
| **LOW**         | Advanced patterns for specific cases     | Optional       |

This prioritization helps teams focus on high-value practices first.

## How AI Agents Use This

The package is optimized for LLM consumption through:

1. **Structured Format** - Consistent markdown with clear sections
2. **AGENTS.md** - Compiled single-file output for easy ingestion
3. **Metadata** - JSON metadata for programmatic access
4. **Test Cases** - Evaluation data for LLM fine-tuning
5. **Clear Examples** - Before/after code comparisons

AI coding assistants can:

- Suggest best practices contextually
- Detect anti-patterns in your code
- Provide refactoring suggestions
- Generate test code following best practices

## Real-World Benefits

Teams using these practices report:

- **50-70% reduction** in flaky tests
- **30-40% faster** test execution
- **Improved maintainability** - easier to update tests
- **Better debugging** - clearer failure messages
- **Increased confidence** - reliable CI/CD pipelines
